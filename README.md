# luo3_app

It gives me great pleasure to introduce a first look at my most recent product, the Luo3 app, a peer-to-peer car rental and driver hiring app!

Branding & Style Guide:
From selecting the perfect colour palette (#104879, anyone?) to designing a logo and defining typography, I have been focused on ensuring Luo3 has trust, innovation, and simplicity.

Wireframes & Early Concepts:
Before looking into UI design and programming, I drew out the user experience with hand-drawn wireframes. 

I'll share another update with the final product once I complete the full UI design and app development! Stay tuned for more progress as Luo3 evolves into a fully functional smart rental app.
